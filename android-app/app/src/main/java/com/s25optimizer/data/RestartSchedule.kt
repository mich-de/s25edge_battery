/**
 * A weekly restart schedule: reboot the phone at a chosen time, on chosen days, but only while
 * nobody is using it.
 *
 * One UI has the same idea — Samsung's "Auto restart" under Device care — but on this device
 * `scpm_restart` is off and its activity is disabled from the factory, so there is nothing to
 * drive. A periodic reboot is the standard answer to One UI drifting after a few days up:
 * fragmented memory, Samsung services accumulating state, the post-update drain documented in
 * the project notes.
 *
 * Config lives in `Settings.Secure`, exactly as [ChargeSchedule] does, so it survives clearing
 * the app's data. Reading needs no permission; writing goes through Shizuku.
